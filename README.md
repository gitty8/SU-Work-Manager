### Google Firebase CLoud
Firebase stores and syncâ€™s data with `NoSQL` cloud database. The Data is synced
across all clients in realtime, and remains available when the app goes offline.
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as
JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client.

It adds `data security` to all node levels by allowing only authenticated users to use and
read the data.
The managers can send `push notifications` to the employees using Firebase.
